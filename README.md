## Implementation

`gnowledge` is mainly written with `bash`, easy to hack & customize.

`gnowledge` is a network installer pulling hundreds of software projects from Ubuntu repositories, Ubuntu PPAs, Github and various direct downloads.

`gnowledge` comes with a Text UI allowing you to configure your instance, select the stack components to install and even pick individual Apps.

If something goes wrong the installer will show a stack trace & spawn an interactive console so you can have fun.
